            <p><h2>
                    Why Claudelands Park</h2></p>
            <br>
            <p1> The Magical Bridge Trust commissioned Brodiehailwood to produce
                an Inclusive Playground Concept to transform the old, tired,
                existing destination playground located at Claudelands Park. The
                Claudelands Park playground was due for renewal by the Hamilton
                City Council. A partnership was formed with the Council whereby
                the budget allocated for the old playground's renewal was made
                available to the trust, which fundraised a further $2m for the
                phase 1 budget, to build New Zealand's first Magical Bridge
                Playground. Phase 1 is now open and is being enthusiastically
                received by the entire community. Funding for the last few items
                in Phase 1 is underway with a Givealittle page now receiving
                donations. Phase 2 funding is underway to add some key items
                such as a toilet block, musical lazer harp, accessible fitness
                zone, sensory dome, and artwork.
                <br>

                The Claudelands Park location was chosen from a range of options
                around Hamilton City but was identified as ideal due to its
                existing facilities including restrooms, accessible car parks,
                picnic areas, shaded seating, and mature trees. Claudelands Park
                is easily accessible by public transport and is located within a
                diverse community - surrounded by young and elderly residents.
                The existing mounding and zip lines in the park have been<br>
                retained for the new playground.</p1>
