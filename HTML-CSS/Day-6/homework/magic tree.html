        <p><h2>1. Yggdrasil (Norse Mythology)</h2><br>
            Description: <br>An enormous ash tree, often depicted with evergreen
            qualities, Yggdrasil is the backbone of Norse cosmology. Its name
            may mean "Odin’s Horse," referencing Odin’s self-sacrifice on its
            branches.<br>
            Details:<br>
            <br><h3>Roots:</h3><br> Three main roots stretch to different realms—Asgard
            (gods), Jotunheim (giants), and Niflheim (underworld)—each fed by a
            sacred well, like the Well of Urd, guarded by the Norns
            (fate-weavers).<br>
           <h3> Creatures:</h3><br> A squirrel (Ratatoskr) runs messages between an eagle at
            the top and a serpent (Nidhogg) gnawing the roots. Deer and other
            beings nibble its leaves, symbolizing the cycle of life.<br>
           <h3> Magic:</h3><br> It’s a living bridge between worlds, resilient even against
            apocalyptic forces, embodying endurance and interconnectedness.
            <h3>Cultural Echo:</h3><br> Its imagery influences modern fantasy, like the World
            Trees in games such as God of War.<br>
           <h2> 2. Tree of Life (Multi-Cultural)</h2>
            Description:<br> A universal symbol of growth, often depicted with
            sprawling branches and deep roots.<br>
            Details:<br>
         <h3> Biblical Role:</h3><br> In Genesis, it’s in Eden alongside the Tree of
            Knowledge. Eating its fruit grants eternal life, but it’s guarded
            after Adam and Eve’s expulsion.<br>

            <h3> Other Traditions:</h3><br>
             In Kabbalah, it’s a mystical diagram of ten nodes
            (Sefirot), mapping creation. In Assyrian art, it’s stylized with
            priests tending it, suggesting divine favor.<br>

           <h3> Magic: </h3><br>Associated with immortality and harmony; its fruit or essence
            is a prize in many tales, like the golden apples of Greek myth.
            Modern Use: Appears in art, jewelry, and even tattoos as a symbol of
            resilience.<br>
            <h2>3. Bodhi Tree (Buddhism)</h2><br>
            A sacred fig tree (Ficus religiosa) tied to Siddhartha
            Gautama’s enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, India, around 500 BCE.<br>
            
        </h3>Event: <h3><br>After 49 days of meditation beneath it, Gautama became the
            Buddha, making it a pilgrimage site. A cutting from the original
            still grows there.<br>

            <h3>Symbolism:</h3><br>
             Its heart-shaped leaves represent compassion and
            enlightenment; they’re often used in Buddhist art.
           <br> Magic: <br>Believed to radiate spiritual energy, inspiring meditation
            and insight.
            <br>Legacy:<br>
             Replanted globally at Buddhist temples, it’s a living relic
            of transcendence.
          <h2> 4. Oak (Celtic Tradition)</h2>
            Called the "King of Trees," the oak (genus Quercus) is
            a towering symbol of strength across Europe.
            Details:
            <br><h3>Druidic Ties:</h3><br>
             Druids held rituals in oak groves, believing the tree
            channeled divine power. Mistletoe on oaks was especially sacred, cut
            with golden sickles for potions.
            <br><h3>Practical Magic:</h3>
             Acorns were fertility charms, and oak wood was used
            for wands or staffs, thought to amplify strength and justice.
            Lore: Lightning often strikes oaks due to their height, linking them
            to thunder gods like Thor or Taranis.
            <h3> Today: </h3><br>
            Still planted for protection or luck in rural traditions.
           <h2> 5. Whomping Willow (Harry Potter)</h2><br> 
           A fictional, enchanted tree from J.K. Rowling’s series,
            planted at Hogwarts in the 1970s.
            <br>
            <h3>Purpose:</h3><br>
             Guards a tunnel to the Shrieking Shack, protecting Remus
            Lupin during his werewolf transformations. It attacks anyone who
            approaches, flailing its branches like fists.<br>
            <h3>Magic:</h3><br>
             Animated by enchantment, it’s both a weapon and a sentinel,
            with a knot that, when pressed, halts its aggression.
            <br><h3>Inspiration:</h3> <br>
            Likely draws from folklore of sentient plants, like the
            Old Man Willow in Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings.
            Impact: A fan favorite, it’s recreated in Universal Studios’
            Wizarding World.</p>
