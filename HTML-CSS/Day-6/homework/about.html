        <p>
            In 2020, a group of likeminded, passionate, and experienced
            individuals of the Hamilton, New Zealand disability community were
            each following the social media pages of the Magical Bridge
            Foundation in the USA. Magical Bridge foundation is a not-for-profit
            that advocates for, designs and builds playgrounds and parks for
            children and adults of all ages, abilities, sizes.<br>

            <br>Already connected personally, they joined together to discuss
            this
            innovative and inclusive playground design and investigate the
            possibility of a magical playground being built in their home
            community, Hamilton. This conversation was the beginning of the
            Magical Bridge Trust, New Zealand. The dream to build a Magical
            Bridge Foundation Playground at Claudelands Park for all members of
            our community to enjoy and benefit from, is now becoming closer to a
            reality.
